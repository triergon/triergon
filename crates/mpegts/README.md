# triergon-mpegts

Bounded, incremental MPEG-2 transport stream reader for 188-byte TS and
192-byte M2TS. It is a format-layer crate on top of `triergon-core` (input cursor,
budgets, exact time) and `triergon-bitstream` (the section CRC). It frames packets, checks
continuity, assembles PSI sections and PAT/PMT tables, and assembles PES
packets with their raw timestamps. A PES is a byte run, not a codec access
unit: access-unit framing belongs to `triergon-framing`, decoding to the codec
crates. The crate does no I/O and does not seek. The `mux` module writes a
single-program stream for one video elementary stream ([Writing TS](#writing-ts)).

The crate exposes two views:

- **Source view** (`TransportStream` and its parts). Every value is a wire
  fact: raw 33-bit PTS/DTS, raw PCR, descriptor bytes, source byte ranges.
  Unknown DTS stays unknown.
- **FFmpeg-compatible view** (`compat::pes`, `compat::input`). It reproduces
  the packets, positions, flags and timestamps of FFmpeg's MPEG-TS demuxer,
  including its handling of damaged and headerless PES. It is fed from the same
  transport packets and never rewrites source facts.

The non-default `reference-trace` feature adds `reference_trace`, the projections
that exist only to compare traces with FFmpeg: `recovery` (packets from rejected
carriers), `catalogue` (programs and streams), `packet_completion` (inputs without
media), `dvb` and `input`.

## Usage

```rust
use std::sync::atomic::AtomicBool;
use triergon_core::{
    Budget, Bytes, InputCursor, InputWindow, SourceCapabilities, SourceId, Step, WorkBudget,
};
use triergon_mpegts::{PacketFormat, ParseLimits, TraceEvent, TransportStream};

# let path = concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/../playback/tests/fixtures/hls/media-00.ts");
let stream = std::fs::read(path)?; // any transport; the parser does no I/O
let pool = Budget::new(64 << 20)?;
let caps = SourceCapabilities { length: Some(stream.len() as u64), random_access: false };
let mut input = InputCursor::new(&pool, SourceId(1), caps, 64 * 1024)?;
let program = 1;
let mut ts = TransportStream::new(pool.clone(), PacketFormat::Ts188, ParseLimits::default(), program)?;
let cancel = AtomicBool::new(false);
let mut pes_count = 0;
loop {
    match ts.poll(&mut input, &mut WorkBudget::new(1 << 16), &cancel)? {
        Step::Ready(TraceEvent::ProgramMap { map, active: true, .. }) => { /* map.streams */ }
        Step::Ready(TraceEvent::Pes(pes)) => {
            // pes.pid, pes.header.pts_raw33, pes.header.dts_raw33, pes.payload()
            pes_count += 1;
        }
        Step::Ready(TraceEvent::Diagnostic(fault)) => { /* kind, pid, location, error */ }
        Step::Ready(TraceEvent::Finished) => break,
        Step::Ready(_) => {} // transport packets, sections, PAT, timeline
        Step::NeedInput(req) => match stream.get(usize::try_from(req.offset)?..) {
            Some(rest) if !rest.is_empty() => {
                let bytes = Bytes::copy_from_slice(&pool, &rest[..rest.len().min(req.maximum)])?;
                input.provide_owned(InputWindow::new(req.source, req.token, req.offset, bytes)?)?;
            }
            _ => input.finish(req.source, req.token)?,
        },
        Step::Yield => {}
        Step::End(_) => ts.end_of_source()?, // only at logical end of media
    }
}
assert!(pes_count > 0);
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

`examples/mpegts_packets.rs FILE [PROGRAM]` prints the streams and PES packets of a
file.

| Task | Entry points |
| --- | --- |
| Whole stream, one program | `TransportStream::{new, new_with_namespace}` |
| One HLS segment (TS188, in-band PAT/PMT) | `TransportStream::new_single_program_segment`, `new_single_program_feed` |
| Sequential TS188 playback input | `TransportStream::new_single_program_progressive_feed` |
| Packets only | `parse_transport`, `TransportFramer`, `carrier::TransportInspector` |
| Continuity | `Continuity::observe` → `ContinuityOutcome` |
| PSI | `SectionAssembler`, `psi::{PatReader, PmtReader, PatCollector}` |
| Descriptors | `psi::Descriptor::{registration, languages, avc_video, hevc_video, dvb_ac3, dvb_eac3, dvb_subtitling}` |
| PES | `PesAssembler` → `Pes`, `PesHeader::{raw_pts_time, raw_dts_time}` |
| Timestamps | `clock::source_timestamp` with `clock::SourceTimePolicy` |
| FFmpeg-compatible PES | `compat::pes::DemuxObserver::{new_registered, new_private_audio, new_hls_private_audio, new_dvb_subtitles}` |
| FFmpeg-compatible clock | `compat::pes::DemuxClock` |
| FFmpeg-compatible start position | `compat::input::InputBootstrap` |

The sequential feed keeps program tables, clock transitions and diagnostics.
`TransportStream::poll_feed` can deliver validated PES continuations directly
in both feed modes. `poll_feed_carriers` lets a progressive feed move a
plain continuation's charged payload storage into the native PES observer.
`poll_feed_with_payload_runs` can offer several payload-only continuations
on one PID from an already shared window. Each carrier keeps its source
range and event ordinal. Runs use reserved span capacity and ordinary
carrier polling handles PES completion and arena growth.
Sequential playback can share up to four tight input windows of at most 4 KiB
each. A full set, oversized backing storage or low budget headroom uses
carrier-sized storage. Fallback uses the original transport event.
`take_feed_omissions` counts
skipped events so consumers can retain positions in the source trace.

`TransportStream::poll_compact` coalesces runs of null packets into one
`CompactTraceEvent::NullRun`.

### Writing TS

`mux::Muxer` writes 188-byte packets for one video elementary stream, one PES per
picture:

```rust
use triergon_mpegts::mux::{MuxConfig, Muxer};

let picture: &[u8] = &[0, 0, 1, 0xb3, 1, 2, 3]; // one coded picture
let mut muxer = Muxer::new(&MuxConfig::default())?;
let mut out = Vec::new();
muxer.write_picture(picture, 3000, 0, true, &mut out); // 90 kHz pts, dts, key; appends to `out`
assert_eq!(out.len() % 188, 0);
# Ok::<(), triergon_core::Error>(())
```

- Tables: PAT, PMT and a DVB SDT with one service descriptor (ETSI EN 300 468),
  version 0, serialised once at `Muxer::new`. The SDT is repeated every 500 ms and
  PAT/PMT every 100 ms of PCR time; PAT/PMT also precede a key picture that follows
  a non-key picture.
- PES: stream_id 0xE0, unbounded length, PTS and DTS. The first packet's
  adaptation field carries PCR = DTS·300 and, on key pictures, the
  random_access_indicator. Stuffing goes into the final packet's adaptation field.
  `TransportStream` does not read this output back: its source view accepts
  unbounded PES only on AVC (0x1b) and HEVC (0x24) streams.
- `MuxConfig::default()`: transport_stream_id 1, original_network_id 0xFF01,
  program 1, PMT PID 0x1000, video PID 0x0100, stream type 0x01, provider
  "Triergon", service "Service01".
- `Muxer::new` returns `Error::Unsupported` for names that are not printable ASCII
  or do not fit one SDT packet together (158 bytes), program number 0, a PMT or
  video PID outside 0x0020–0x1FFE, equal PMT and video PIDs, and stream types other
  than 0x01 and 0x02.

| Item | FFmpeg 9.0.2 | `mux` | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| PMT stream type | 0x02 | 0x01 by default, 0x02 selectable | H.222.0 Table 2-34 reserves 0x02 for constrained-parameter 11172-2 video |
| SDT provider | "FFmpeg" | "Triergon" by default, selectable | do not claim another implementation's identity |

`tests/mux.rs` checks SDT size limits and CRC, name encoding, PID and program
validation. The written stream is compared with FFmpeg's through the capture
pipeline ([triergon-capture](../capture/README.md#conformance)).

## Behaviour and limits

- **Input.** The caller owns I/O through the core `InputCursor` and polls with
  a `WorkBudget` and a cancel flag. One poll yields at most one event. The
  packet size is chosen by the caller; there is no resynchronisation or
  auto-detection in the source view.
- **Bounds.** `ParseLimits` caps section bytes (default 4096, maximum 4096),
  PES bytes (16 MiB), source spans (4096), programs (64), streams (64) and
  descriptors (256). All storage is charged to the shared `Budget`; emitted
  `Bytes` charge their whole backing allocation. A rejected push returns the
  original bytes; backpressure must be resolved by the caller releasing
  output, not by retrying in a loop.
- **Program selection.** `TransportStream` produces PES for one program: the
  one named by the caller, or the only program in the PAT
  (`new_single_program_segment`). Other PAT programs are reported but not
  demultiplexed. A PAT/PMT becomes active only when complete, current and
  CRC-valid.
- **Damage.** `TransportStream` reports each fault as
  `TraceEvent::Diagnostic` and keeps going. TEI, scrambled, lost and
  excess-duplicate packets discard the affected partial section or PES; their
  payload is never used. A bad PSI pointer is reported and parsing resumes at
  the next payload unit start. The standalone assemblers keep a fault sticky
  until their `discard`.
- **Timestamps.** `PesHeader` keeps raw 33-bit PTS/DTS; a missing DTS is never
  filled from PTS in the source view. `clock::source_timestamp` lifts raw
  values to exact time only under an explicit `SourceTimePolicy`
  (`Unanchored`, `RelativeEpochZero`, or `Bounded` by a PCR/PTS anchor) and
  reports ambiguous or out-of-bound values instead of guessing a wrap.
  Invalid PCR signalling sets `clock_is_quarantined()` until an explicit
  `discontinuity()`.
- **Discontinuities and segments.** A signalled PCR discontinuity followed
  by a new PCR starts a new clock epoch (`TraceEvent::Timeline`) and drops
  partial PES. A caller `discontinuity()` (for example an HLS discontinuity
  tag between segments) advances both clock and configuration epochs and
  resets PSI state. Ending one source entity (`media_entity_end`) does not
  flush a PES; only `end_of_source()` at logical end of media does.
- **Descriptor namespace.** Private descriptor tags are interpreted as DVB
  only under `psi::DescriptorNamespace::Dvb`, supplied by the caller through
  `new_with_namespace`. The default is `Unspecified`.
- **FFmpeg-compatible view.** Each observer is bound to one program, PID,
  stream type and stream ID (`DemuxScope`). Contexts outside the observed
  profile return `Error::Unsupported`.
- **Not handled.** SI tables beyond PAT/PMT (their packets are still reported),
  ATSC/Blu-ray signalling, descrambling, seeking, multi-program PES output.

## Conformance

Specification basis:

- ITU-T H.222.0 (08/2023): §2.4.3.1–2.4.3.5 (transport packet, adaptation
  field), §2.4.3.6–2.4.3.8 (PES), §2.4.4 and §2.6 (PSI and descriptors),
  Annex A (CRC-32).
- ETSI EN 300 468: §6.2.41 / Table 99 (subtitling descriptor), Annex D.3 and
  D.5 (AC-3 and E-AC-3 descriptors).

Verification:

- Integration tests under `tests/` use independently authored transport
  streams in `tests/data/` (listed in `tests/data/manifest.json`) with
  expected values derived from the specifications.
- The source view is compared field by field with an independent oracle over
  the corpus. The FFmpeg-compatible view is compared packet by packet
  (payload bytes, timestamps, flags, positions, stream-ID side data) with the
  FFmpeg reference; nonmatching cases are kept as failures, not normalised.
